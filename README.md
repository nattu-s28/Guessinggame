# Guessinggame
This Streamlit application is an interactive **Guessing Game** offering two distinct modes: **User Guessing Mode** and **Machine Guessing Mode**. In the User Guessing Mode, the computer randomly selects a number within a user-specified range, and the user attempts to guess it, receiving feedback if their guess is too high or too low. The game tracks the number of attempts and congratulates the user upon a correct guess. In the Machine Guessing Mode, the user thinks of a number, and the machine uses binary search to guess it. Based on the user’s feedback ("Correct", "Too High", or "Too Low"), the machine refines its guesses until it identifies the correct number, also displaying the total attempts. The app leverages **Streamlit's session state** to maintain the game’s state across user interactions, ensuring seamless gameplay.
